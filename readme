# 📄 GistGenie – Automate Meeting Insights & Follow-Ups with AI

GistGenie is a no-code/low-code automation built in **n8n** that turns your Google Meet transcripts into smart summaries, personalized to-do lists, and calendar reminders — all triggered automatically from your Google Drive.

## What It Does

Whenever a transcript file is exported (e.g., from Tactiq) and dropped into your Google Drive:

1. **Trigger**: Google Drive detects the new file.
2. **Ingest**: The document is retrieved and its raw text is extracted.
3. **AI Summary**: An AI agent summarizes the meeting and identifies key takeaways and tasks.
4. **Smart Outputs**:
   - Saves summaries in Google Sheets
   - Creates personalized task items in Google Tasks
   - Schedules follow-up events in Google Calendar

No more post-meeting chaos. Just instant clarity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **n8n** (workflow orchestration)
- **Google Drive API** (trigger)

- **OpenAI / Azure OpenAI** (AI-powered summarization)

- Google API credentials for:
  - Drive

### How to Use

1. Clone this repo.

> Bonus: The AI agent uses memory to keep context, ensuring follow-ups are relevant and smart.

- Creates a bulleted summary
- Assigns "Design dashboard UI" to Ayush in Google Tasks

All in under a minute.
